A language server for agent skills — `/skill-name` and `$skill-name` become real symbols in VS Code, Zed, Neovim, and Helix.

▸ completion w/ descriptions on `/` and `$`\
▸ "did you mean" on typos\
▸ go to definition, find references\
▸ F2 rename w/ editor undo — folder, frontmatter `name:`, and every reference update as one edit\
▸ clickable links + semantic highlighting on resolved references

Your skill library now has tooling.

## Why

Skills, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, and agent files reference each other by name — a dependency graph with all the refactoring hazards of code and none of the tooling. Rename a skill by hand and stale references look like ordinary prose: nothing errors, the agent silently stops loading the skill.

Quiet by design — a false reference in prose costs more than a missed one:

- Fenced code blocks are never parsed; inline code spans are (that's how people write skill names in prose)
- `/usr/bin`, `$PATH`, `docs/` — never references, never popups
- Near miss of a real skill (edit distance ≤ 2) → *did you mean* warning; other unresolved `/name` → info hint; unresolved `$name` → silent
- Built-in commands (`/help`, `/compact`, …) and your own `.claude/commands`/`.codex/prompts` are commands, not skills — never flagged

It's a language server, not a linter — pair with `skill-lint` or `agnix` for structural/security linting.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g skill-language-server
```

Then wire up your editor below. To see it work: cursor on any `/skill-name`, hit `F2`, type a new name — folder, frontmatter, and every reference update as one undo step.

### Helix

```toml
# languages.toml
[language-server.skill-language-server]
command = "skill-language-server"
args = ["--stdio"]

[[language]]
name = "markdown"
language-servers = ["skill-language-server"]  # add e.g. "marksman" here if you use it
```

### Neovim (0.11+)

Create `~/.config/nvim/lsp/skill-language-server.lua`:

```lua
return {
  cmd = { "skill-language-server", "--stdio" },
  filetypes = { "markdown" },
  root_markers = { ".claude", ".git" },
}
```

Add `vim.lsp.enable("skill-language-server")` to init.lua. (Or from a clone: `{ dir = "/path/to/skill-language-server/ext/nvim" }` in lazy.nvim.)

### Zed

Command palette → `zed: install dev extension` → select `ext/zed/` from a clone. After server updates: `editor: restart language server`.

### VS Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CyrusNuevoDia/skill-language-server
cd skill-language-server
mise trust && mise install && bun install
just build-vscode
code --install-extension dist/skill-language-server.vsix
```

(Marketplace listing pending — the .vsix bundles the server.)

### From source

```sh
mise trust && mise install   # bun, just (rust only for the Zed wasm)
bun install
just bin                     # → ~/.local/bin/skill-language-server
```

## How it scans

The server's world is the folder your editor opened — it never reads outside it. A rename touches exactly the tree you have open, never another checkout or your home directory. Open `~/.claude` itself as a workspace to refactor your global library.

- **Skills** = any `**/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Folder name is canonical; a disagreeing frontmatter `name:` is an error, not an alias
- **References** are scanned in `.md` files under `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, or `skills/`, plus every `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. Markdown elsewhere is never touched
- **Live index** where the editor supports LSP file watching; open buffers beat disk. Without watching, the index catches up on file open or restart
- **`.skillignore`** (gitignore syntax, workspace root) excludes paths from everything
- Multi-root workspaces: only the first folder is indexed

Cross-workspace renames are a deliberate two-step: rename where the skill lives, then open the other workspace — stale references surface as hints/warnings there. Blind spots: `$` stragglers stay silent, and an old name that doubles as a built-in command reads as the built-in.

## Client compatibility

Checked against client source as of 2026-07: VS Code, Zed, Helix, and Neovim all apply the folder `RenameFile`.

- Neovim never sends `willRenameFiles` — explorer-drag renames don't rewrite references there; rename from a token or the frontmatter instead
- File watching: VS Code and Zed yes; Neovim yes except off by default on Linux; Helix only sees its own edits — reopen the file or restart the server after external changes

## Development

```sh
just check   # tsc (server + VS Code extension) + ultracite lint
bun test     # protocol-level tests against a fixture workspace
just build   # everything into dist/ — binary, .vsix, Zed wasm (wasm needs rust)
just fmt     # ultracite fix --unsafe
```

The test suite is the contract: `tests/harness.ts` boots the real server over in-memory streams; `tests/corpus.ts` is the ground-truth reference set. Done = `just check` + `bun test` green.

Three layers in `src/`: `parse.ts` (token grammar), `workspace.ts` (index), `server.ts` (LSP wiring). Editor shims in `ext/{vscode,zed,nvim}`.
