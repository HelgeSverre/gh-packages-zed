Favo is the honeycomb. This theme started as the look of [favo](https://github.com/irwinarruda/favo-cli), and grew into a theme for everything around it: your editor, your terminal and your coding agents. Switch GitHub between dark and light to see both variants.

## Why Favo

**Honey leads.** Keywords carry the honey color, so a file has a shape before you read a word of it.

**Each color has one job.** Sky is what runs, mint is the shape of data, meadow is text, lavender is a fixed value, rose is what was passed in, and coral is a pattern or a problem. Variables and properties stay in the plain text color, so color marks structure rather than everything.

**Tags and components never blur.** In JSX, `<div>` is honey and `<LoginCard>` is mint italic, so you can see what is markup and what is yours.

**Italic means "from somewhere else".** Parameters, type parameters, attributes and components are italic, because they arrive from outside the line you are reading.

**Contrast is a contract, not a feeling.** These numbers are checked on every commit:

|                                     | Favo Honey | Favo Wax |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Weakest code color on the background | 7.11:1     | 4.63:1   |
| Comments on the background          | 6.29:1     | 4.12:1   |
| Weakest code color on a selection   | 4.96:1     | 3.85:1   |
| Closest two code colors (OKLab)     | 0.12       | 0.10     |

Honey clears WCAG AAA and Wax clears AA for all code. Everything else is in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md): every color, every token rule and every interface rule, written so you can port Favo to anything.

## Install

Clone this repository for any app below that copies files, or run `bun run install-themes` from a clone to copy the Ghostty, Zed, OpenCode, T3 Code and Herdr files at once.

### Neovim

Written in Lua from scratch, and tested on Neovim 0.12. With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "irwinarruda/favo-theme",
  name = "favo",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    require("favo").setup({ transparent = false, italics = true })
    vim.cmd.colorscheme("favo-honey")
  end,
}
```

Use `favo-wax` for the light variant. It covers tree-sitter, LSP semantic tokens, diagnostics and popular plugins: gitsigns, Telescope, nvim-cmp, blink.cmp, which-key, noice, nvim-notify, indent-blankline, rainbow-delimiters, neo-tree, nvim-tree, Trouble, nvim-dap, lazy.nvim, mason, alpha-nvim and fzf-lua.

For lualine, set `theme = "favo"`.

### Vim

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'irwinarruda/favo-theme', { 'rtp': 'vim' }

set termguicolors
colorscheme favo-honey
```

Without a plugin manager, copy `vim/colors/*.vim` to `~/.vim/colors/`. Colors are approximated in 256-color terminals, so use `termguicolors` when you can.

### Zed

Copy [`zed/themes/favo.json`](zed/themes/favo.json) to `~/.config/zed/themes/`, then pick **Favo Honey** or **Favo Wax** from the theme selector.

For the full effect, add [`zed/semantic-tokens.jsonc`](zed/semantic-tokens.jsonc) to your Zed settings. It turns on language server highlighting and maps it to Favo, including read-only variables, which a Zed theme can't do alone.

### Ghostty

Copy `ghostty/favo-honey` and `ghostty/favo-wax` to `~/.config/ghostty/themes/`, then set one in your config:

```
theme = light:favo-wax,dark:favo-honey
```

### OpenCode

Copy `opencode/*.json` to `~/.config/opencode/themes/`, then run `/theme` to pick one.

### T3 Code

Copy `t3code/*.json` to `~/.t3/userdata/themes/`, then run `t3 theme set favo-honey`. These have to be real files, because T3 Code ignores symlinks there.

### Herdr

Paste the contents of `herdr/favo-honey.toml` into `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`, replacing any `[theme]` section, then run `herdr server reload-config`.

### favo

Honey and Wax are built in:

```sh
favo theme honey
favo theme wax
```

## Port it

Favo is one [`palette.json`](palette.json) and one [spec](SPEC.md). If your favorite app is missing, the spec has everything you need, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how to add it here.

## Credits

Favo is inspired by how [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) handles contrast and syntax highlighting, especially in TypeScript projects. The full story, including Favo's closest relatives, is in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).
