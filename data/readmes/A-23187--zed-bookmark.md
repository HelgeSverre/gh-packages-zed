## Setup
1. Install [the extension](https://zed.dev/extensions/bookmark) from the Zed extension marketplace
2. Enable the bookmark language server by adding the following to your `.zed/settings.json` (or `~/.config/zed/settings.json` for all workspaces)
```json
{
  "languages": {
    "Plain Text": {
      "language_servers": ["bookmark-language-server"]
    }
  },
}
```
3. Add the following tasks to your `.zed/tasks.json` (or `~/.config/zed/tasks.json` for all workspaces)
```json
[
  {
    "label": "Bookmark: Add bookmark",
    "command": "read -e -i \"$(sed -n \"${ZED_ROW}p\" \"${ZED_RELATIVE_FILE}\")\" && echo -e \"\\n$REPLY\\n${ZED_RELATIVE_FILE}:$((${ZED_ROW} - 1)):$((${ZED_COLUMN} - 1))\" >> .zed/bookmarks.txt",
    "env": {},
    "hide": "on_success",
    "reveal": "always"
  },
  {
    "label": "Bookmark: Find bookmark",
    "command": "zed",
    "args": [".zed/bookmarks.txt"],
    "env": {},
    "hide": "always",
    "reveal": "never"
  }
]
```
4. (Optional) Bind your custom key bindings to the tasks added previously, by editing `.zed/keymap.json` (or `~/.config/zed/keymap.json` for all workspaces). For example:
```json
[
  {
    "context": "Workspace",
    "bindings": {
      "alt-m": ["task::Spawn", { "task_name": "Bookmark: Add bookmark" }]
    }
  }
]
```
