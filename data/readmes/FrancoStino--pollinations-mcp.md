# Pollinations Multimodal MCP Server

Pollinations MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the [Pollinations AI APIs](https://pollinations.ai) that enables AI assistants and tools (such as Zed or Claude) to generate images, text, and audio directly. This server follows the "thin proxy" design principle, focusing on minimal data transformation and direct communication through stdio.

This extension integrates the MCP server into the [Zed](https://zed.dev) code editor, providing seamless access to Pollinations AI features directly within your development environment.

## Features

- Generate actual images and return them as base64-encoded data
- Generate text responses from text prompts
- Generate audio (text-to-speech) from text prompts
- List available image and text generation models
- STDIO transport for easy integration with MCP clients
- Simple and lightweight
- Compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Context Server Integration:** Registers a context server in Zed that communicates with Pollinations MCP via a Node.js process.
- **Zero Configuration:** Works out-of-the-box with Zed, requiring minimal setup.
