Professional language support for Enhanced Edition Infinity Engine Lua and `.menu` files.

This repository ships:

- A Visual Studio Code extension.
- A stdio-capable Language Server Protocol server for editors such as Kate.

This extension targets:

- Lua 5.2 with the base globals and the `bit32`, `debug`, `math`, `string`, and `table` libraries.
- LuaJIT compatibility mode.
- Infinity Engine `.lua` files.
- Infinity Engine `.menu` files with embedded Lua regions.

## Features

- Completion, hover, signature help, go to definition, find references, same-file rename, diagnostics, formatting, document symbols, workspace symbols, semantic tokens, and folding. <!-- feature: language-services -->
- Scope-aware Lua analysis backed by a parser plus tolerant fallback scanning for incomplete buffers. <!-- feature: scope-and-fallback -->
- Embedded Lua analysis in `.menu` files for backtick chunks, `lua "..."` expressions, action/open/close/escape blocks, and `enabled`/`clickable` expressions. <!-- feature: embedded-lua -->
- Source-driven API data from official sources only, with immutable upstream provenance. <!-- feature: source-provenance -->
- Full EE Game Lua and EEex function completion, hover, signature help, and source definitions, including namespace members, colon methods, typed instance aliases, parameter defaults, return values, warnings, notes, examples, and tables. <!-- feature: function-api -->
- Full EE Game Structures (x64) layout metadata: structure and field completion, annotation-aware member resolution, chained field hover, exact source definitions, types, offsets, and byte sizes. <!-- feature: structure-api -->

## Stable 0.6.x contract and current limits

The prepared 0.6.0 milestone targets the stable channel. Within 0.6.x, documented setting keys,
command IDs, language IDs, and supported editor/runtime behavior remain compatible; intentional
correctness fixes are described in the changelog. Publication status is shown in GitHub Releases.

Workspace symbols and Validate Workspace cover **open documents**. Navigation and rename use
same-document lexical bindings. API-backed member completion is not general-purpose Lua type inference.

Formatting only removes trailing spaces and tabs outside Lua strings and comments. It preserves
line endings and final-newline state, protects unfinished strings/comments, and leaves `.menu`
documents unchanged. `ieLua.formatter.configPath` is retained for compatibility but currently unused;
no external formatter or workspace executable is invoked.

If API data is unavailable at startup, lexical language services remain usable with an empty API
index. Failed reloads retain the previous index and display an error. Use **IE Lua: Open Server Log**
to identify unreadable or invalid candidates, restore the data, and retry **IE Lua: Reload API Data**.
A successful reload refreshes API services immediately; diagnostics update on the next configured
validation trigger. Validate Document requires a supported active editor, including untitled documents.

The [0.6.0 release record](docs/release/0.6.0.md) describes acceptance criteria and coverage limits.

## Runtime Dependencies

Visual Studio Code users do **not** need to install `luaparse`, Node.js, npm, or any other npm package to use validation. The published Marketplace extension and generated VSIX bundle the language server runtime dependencies.

Kate users do not need `luaparse` or npm packages, but they do need Node.js 24 LTS available on `PATH` because Kate starts the bundled server as an external stdio process.

## Using with Visual Studio Code

For Windows, macOS, and Linux:

1. Install **IE Lua Language Server** from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, or install the generated `.vsix`.
2. Reload Visual Studio Code if prompted.
3. Open an Infinity Engine `.lua` or `.menu` file.

Settings can be changed from the Visual Studio Code Settings UI or `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ieLua.dialect": "lua52",
  "ieLua.validation.mode": "save",
  "ieLua.validation.debounceMs": 300,
  "ieLua.diagnostics.unknownGlobals": "off"
}
```

The extension activates automatically for `.lua` and `.menu` files and exposes the commands listed below.

## Using with Kate

Kate integration uses the same bundled LSP server over stdin/stdout. This is useful when you want completion, hover, diagnostics, definitions, references, symbols, and formatting outside Visual Studio Code.

Requirements:

- Kate with the **LSP Client** plugin enabled.
- Node.js 24 LTS on `PATH`.
- A built checkout or unpacked VSIX containing `dist/server/server.js` and `resources/api/api-index.json`.

Download and unpack a verified VSIX from the CI workflow artifacts or GitHub Releases. Source builds run exclusively in GitHub Actions.

Install the optional `.menu` syntax definition so Kate can map `*.menu` files to the `ie-menu` LSP language id:

```sh
install -D editors/kate/syntax/ie-menu.xml ~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/ie-menu.xml
```

For Flatpak, Snap, Windows, or custom KDE paths, use the syntax-definition directory reported by Kate/KDE. KDE documents the generic user location as `org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/` under a `qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation` directory, and the Windows user location as `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\org.kde.syntax-highlighting\syntax`.

Then open **Settings** -> **Configure Kate** -> **Plugins**, enable **LSP Client**, and add this to **LSP Client** -> **User Server Settings**. Replace `/absolute/path/to/ie-lua-language-server` with this checkout or unpacked VSIX extension directory:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ie-lua": {
      "command": [
        "node",
        "/absolute/path/to/ie-lua-language-server/dist/server/server.js",
        "--stdio"
      ],
      "rootIndicationFileNames": [".git"],
      "url": "https://github.com/4Luke4/ie-lua-language-server",
      "highlightingModeRegex": "^Lua$",
      "settings": {
        "ieLua": {
          "validation": {
            "mode": "save",
            "debounceMs": 300
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "ie-menu": {
      "command": [
        "node",
        "/absolute/path/to/ie-lua-language-server/dist/server/server.js",
        "--stdio"
      ],
      "rootIndicationFileNames": [".git"],
      "url": "https://github.com/4Luke4/ie-lua-language-server",
      "highlightingModeRegex": "^IE Menu$",
      "settings": {
        "ieLua": {
          "validation": {
            "mode": "save",
            "debounceMs": 300
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The same JSON is available as `editors/kate/lsp-client.example.json`.

Kate's LSP Client plugin communicates with configured servers over stdin/stdout and uses `highlightingModeRegex` to map Kate highlighting modes to server entries. See the official Kate LSP Client documentation: `https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/kate/kate-application-plugin-lspclient.html`.

Node.js and npm are only required when building/testing this repository or when launching the stdio server from a non-VS Code editor.

## Validation Modes

`ieLua.validation.mode` controls when diagnostics run:

- `manual`: only through `IE Lua: Validate Document` or `IE Lua: Validate Workspace`.
- `save`: on save. This is the default.
- `type`: while editing, using the configured debounce delay.
- `saveAndType`: on save and while editing, using the configured debounce delay for edits.

`ieLua.validation.debounceMs` controls the type-validation delay in milliseconds and defaults to `300`. Lower values make diagnostics appear sooner but may increase CPU usage during rapid edits. Higher values coalesce more edits and reduce repeated validation work, but diagnostics take longer to appear.

## Commands

- `IE Lua: Validate Document`
- `IE Lua: Validate Workspace`
- `IE Lua: Reload API Data`
- `IE Lua: Show API Source`
- `IE Lua: Open Server Log`

## Development

Node.js 24 LTS and npm are required. This repository is structured as a TypeScript npm workspace.

Open a draft PR to run CI. Compilation, formatting, tests, packaging, and API generation run
exclusively in GitHub Actions. Download verified VSIX files and maintenance patches from the run.
The language server runs as a separate process over IPC from the VS Code extension client.

The docs-ingestion step fetches official Lua 5.2, LuaJIT, EE Game Lua Function, and EEex Function documentation at build time and stores the source wording as Markdown for hover, completion, and signature-help previews. RST presentation is converted to equivalent VS Code Markdown while paragraphs, emphasis, lists, tables, admonitions, links, code blocks, and visible punctuation are retained.

Generated API data uses a schema-v3 manifest for auditability. `resources/api/api-index.json` retains the six logical source sections and lists every data file with its symbol count and, for EE/EEex data, its exact upstream category path. The three EEex-backed sources mirror the top-level categories in the pinned upstream toctrees, including explicit empty shards:

- `resources/api/sections/ee-game-lua-functions/`
- `resources/api/sections/eeex-functions/`
- `resources/api/sections/ee-game-structures-x64/`

Lua 5.2, LuaJIT, and optional local utility metadata remain single-file sections under `resources/api/sections/`. Category filenames are derived deterministically from upstream names rather than maintained as a hardcoded list.

The Actions ingestion job sets `IE_LUA_FETCH_EEEX=1` to refresh EEex metadata. The generator resolves the latest `dev` revision by default; set `IE_LUA_EEEX_COMMIT` to a full commit SHA for a reproducible run. Function ingestion discovers every standalone EE Game function page, every game function defined directly in a category index, and every `EEex_*` function anchor from the pinned tree. It rejects incomplete or malformed input and records exact commit-and-line provenance. Structure help includes names, fields, types, offsets, byte sizes, upstream narrative, and pinned source lines.

The scheduled **Update EEex API data** workflow checks the upstream repository daily. When its revision changes, the workflow regenerates and verifies the API data on a dedicated branch and opens a pull request for review; it never executes upstream code.

Local game files under `samples/` are ignored because they may contain proprietary official content. Set `IE_LUA_SCAN_LOCAL_UTIL=1` only when you intentionally want an ingestion run in an approved Actions environment to derive EE Utility Function metadata from an untracked `samples/util.lua` file.

## Release Process

Stable and prerelease publishing instructions are maintained in `docs/release.md`.

CI audits both stable and prerelease VSIX files; select the intended channel in the Release workflow. The prerelease path uses VS Code's `--pre-release` flag; do not put a SemVer prerelease suffix in `package.json.version`.
